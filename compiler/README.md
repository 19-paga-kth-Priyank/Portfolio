This was a part of my compilers course at KTH. I have designed a compiler for a subset of C language. 

Key takeaways:

1. Developing, testing and debugging of complex software systems.
2. Assembly code generation, degugging and optimization.
3. Dynamics of programming language with respect to type checking.
4. Working of a compiler.
