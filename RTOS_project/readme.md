This project was the part of the lab I had worked on for my embedded systems course.

Key takeaways:

Design, testing and debugging of RTOS.
Use of various tools such as semaphores, mailboxes in order to implement synchronized processes.
Design of algorithms to control parameter and implementing functionality.
